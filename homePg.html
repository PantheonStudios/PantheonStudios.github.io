        <h1> Intro </h1>
        <p> In 2781, three clones were left on the streets of New York City.
            They were each adopted or taken in by different families or groups of people,
            and grew up to have very different lives and personalities.</p>

                    <td> <p align='center'> Lynae was adopted by a couple who were unable to have children of their own.
                    She has the power to change organic material into something else (e.g.: tools, weapons)
                    and to create semi-living constructs. She has a clean criminal record and cannot even jaywalk.

                    <td> <p align='center'> Tegan grew up having a strict but privileged family and an over-controlling mother. Due to that, Tegan is polite, obedient, and smart,
                      but also sheltered and ignorant.
                      Initially Tegan was unaware of her powers, but she later learned that
                      she can wither everything she touches and turn it to gold dust.

                    <td> <p align='center'> Marigold was raised by criminals who thought that she
                      could become their legacy. Since they were always on the run, Marigold learned to lie, hide, rob, and steal.
                      Since the people around her were always coming and going, she also learned to be independent, pitiless, and always skeptical.
                      Marigoldâ€™s power is telekinesis, which means that she can control inanimate objects at will.
