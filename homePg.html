                    <td> <p align='center'> Lynae was adopted by a couple who were unable to have children of their own and who desperately wanted to be parents. She was raised believing that everyone is inherently good and that with necessary help and resources, they can become better beings. Lynae has the power to change organic material into something else (e.g.: tools, weapons) and to create semi-living constructs. Once fully aware of her powers, Lynae uses them to help others. She has a clean criminal record and cannot even jaywalk. </p> </td>

                    </td>
                    <td> <p align='center'> Tegan is one of the three clones left in New York City. She was adopted by a rich couple who wanted to earn a good reputation for taking in a "wretched street orphan." She grew up having a strict but privileged family and an over-controlling mother. Due to her upbringing, Tegan is polite, obedient, and smart, but also sheltered and ignorant about society’s problems.
                                            Initially Tegan was unaware of her powers, but she gradually learned that she has the ability to wither everything that her fingers touch and that she could destroy everything that she touches and turn it to gold dust. To prevent accidental destruction and from getting her hands germy, Tegan wears gloves. She enjoys fencing, horseback riding, and playing tennis.

                    <td> <p align='center'> Marigold was the last to be taken. She was raised by a gang of criminals who saw the potential in taking a child that could become their legacy. Due to the fact that they were always on the run, Marigold learned necessary skills like lying and hiding from the authorities, pickpocketing, and robbing grocery stores early in her life. Since the people around her were always coming and going, she also learned to be independent, pitiless, and always skeptical, especially towards rich and happy families.
                    Marigold’s power is telekinesis. She can control inanimate objects at will. This allowed her to get almost everything solely by stealing, but at the same time made her completely invisible and socially isolated.
