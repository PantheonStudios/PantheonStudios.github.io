<p> You start to jog towards your home and hideout, keeping a watch for anyone following you.
once you arrive you look around, seeing the place youve called home for a while now.
You have a small bed, a set of drawers, a few belongings as well as a safe that you managed to steal a
few years back now. You notice a necklace on the ground that looks valuable as well. </p>
