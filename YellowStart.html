<br></br>
<p> You're in an alley looking for your next target.</p>
<p> You spot a blue-haired girl who looks rich,</p>
<p> and she carries a purse that looks easy to rob.</p>
<p>There are others nearby, but she doesn't look too strong.</p>
<p> You know that you can easily take the wallet without a fight using telekenesis,</p>
<p> or you can do it the old-fashioned way,</p>
<p> take it and risk a possible fight. </p>
