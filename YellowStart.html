<h1 style="color:gold"> You have selected Marigold! </h1>
<p> You're in an alley looking for your next target. You spot a blue-haired girl who looks rich,
    and she carries a purse that looks easy to rob. There are others nearby, but she doesn't look too strong.
    You know that you can easily take the wallet without a fight using telekenesis, or you can do it the old-fashioned
    way, take it and risk a possible fight.
