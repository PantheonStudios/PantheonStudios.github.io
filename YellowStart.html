<p> Youre in an alleyway looking for your next target. You spot a blue haired girl who seemes to be wealthy,
    and she carries a purse that looks easy to get into. There are others nearby, but she dosnt look too strong.
    You know that you could easily take the wallet without a fight using telekenesis, or you could do it theold  fashioned
    way and take it and risk a possible fight.
