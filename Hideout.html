<p> You start to jog towards your home (aka hideout), keeping a watch for anyone that may be following you.
oOce you arrived, you look around, seeing the place you've called home for a while.
You have a small bed, a set of drawers, a few other belongings, as well as a safe that you managed to steal a
few years ago. Then you notice a necklace on the ground that looks valuable as well. </p>
